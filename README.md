# Barcelona Metro Lines

Disclaimer: I did not write (most of) this code. I just asked Cursor to write
it for me.

Just a toy project to demonstrate the capabilities of Cursor. I'm not a frontend
developer, and it would have taken me quite a long time to write this code.
However, in 15min or so, I was able to have this page looking the way I wanted
it to.

Surely, seasoned frontend developers can write this code in a matter of
minutes and, most certainly, better written.
